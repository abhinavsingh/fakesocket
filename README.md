Fake (mock) sockets in Java for unit testing

See [Redis Client Test](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/fakesocket/blob/master/test/TestRedisClient.java) 
for usage when testing socket code. This file contains test cases for a starter 
[Redis Client Library](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/fakesocket/blob/master/test/RedisClient.java) that 
only supports `set` and `delete` Redis commands.
